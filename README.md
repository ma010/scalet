metabolomics: based on scan number, parse mzXML containing mass spectrometry data into smaller XML files.

utility: decode base64 string in the mzXML file and unpack bytes to float which contains peak information from the mass spectrometry data.
misc: use scala to solve algorithm problems with detailed annotation.
